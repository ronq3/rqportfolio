		<h3>Hi, my name is Ron Quattrocchi III, I'm majoring in Digital Media Production and expect to be graduating this summer. I have gathered boatloads of experience at SUNY Plattsburgh
having created all sorts of Digital Media at college for the last 3 years. Before that I was doing similar work in highschool taking graphic heavy tech classes. I've always been working towards
being able to create a future in the Digital Media realm for myself. I have experience in pretty much all programs of Adobe. I've known Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro for atleast 4 years, since highschool.
I've recently come to learn InDesign, Audition and After Effects. I'm capapble capturing photography or videography as well, and being able to properly capture sound.		</h3>
